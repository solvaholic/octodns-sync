## [2.0.0] - 2020-03-25

- Rename **octodns-action** to **octodns-sync**.
- Pull image from Docker hub public repo.
- Run time ~20s for small configuration.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-03-22

### Available on Docker hub

Use the prebuilt image from Docker hub in your workflow, for faster run times.

To see how, check out [_Example workflow_](https://github.com/solvaholic/octodns-action/tree/0b6e3b5b49a78bca8c6b6095fdf990fee0ecfe1d#example-workflow) in the README.

### Uses python:3-slim

I went back to -slim for a more familiar environment inside the Docker container.

### Ignores pip-extras

The prebuilt image includes all of **octodns**'s dependencies.

If these or any of the other changes in this release cause an issue for you, please [let me know](https://github.com/solvaholic/octodns-action/issues/new/choose).

## [1.0.6] - 2020-03-09

**Uses python:3-alpine rather than python:3-slim**

The python:3-alpine image is smaller, and shares more of its base with [the images cached for Linux runners](https://help.github.com/actions/reference/software-installed-on-github-hosted-runners). This change brought runtime for publishing a simple change down to 35 seconds. (v1.0.3 took 1min 10sec.)

If speed is very important, though, then just run [octodns-action.sh](https://github.com/solvaholic/octodns-action/blob/v1.0.6/octodns-action.sh) from your workflow - the runners have python and pip.

## [1.0.5] - 2020-03-07

Moves work from `Dockerfile` and `entrypoint.sh` to `octodns-action.sh`.

## [1.0.4] - 2020-03-07

Updated title in README; Added chmod to Dockerfile to ensure /entrypoint.sh will be executable.

## [1.0.3] - 2020-03-05

v1 provides basic functionality, passed limited manual testing with Route53.

`--doit` deployments with a small config and small change have been taking about 1min 10sec.

Have comments or questions? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/solvaholic/octodns-action/issues/new/choose).

## [1.0.0] - 2020-03-05

Initial realease. Local and workflow runs tested OK with a few record types in Route53.
